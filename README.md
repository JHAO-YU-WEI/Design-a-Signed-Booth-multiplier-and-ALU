# Design_a_Signed_Booth_multiplier_and_ALU
Design a Signed Booth multiplier and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The Booth multiplier Unit.
1.Use Radix-4 Booth multiplier operation.
2.In the Booth multiplier operation, input should be converted to 2's complement numbers.
3.Radix-4 booth recoding table is used to calculate the multiplication result.
4.Handle -0 problem.
####RTL coding algorithm design (Only using Verilog HDL structural-level descriptions, Verilog HDL behavior-level is only used to verify the results.)
